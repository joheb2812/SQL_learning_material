<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to make people's lives easier and more efficient, but the trade-off could be the potential issues that could arise over the security of collected personal data.</p>

<p>If you're developing IoT devices, you must address these privacy issues when designing your device. Do so despite the current lack of an up-to-date guiding law in the area.</p>

<p>IoT devices need the Privacy Policy agreement if the device collects personal information from users.</p>
